## Technologies Used

This e-commerce project is built using a variety of modern web development technologies:

- **Frontend**: The frontend of this application is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version 13 as its React framework, which enables features like server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.

- **TypeScript**: The project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language. TypeScript helps writing safer and more understandable code.

- **Database**: It also uses [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) as its database. MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database developed by the same people that build MongoDB. The application data is stored in a MongoDB database, and it interacts with that data using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), an open-source database toolkit.

- **Authentication**: User authentication in this project is handled by [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/), a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It's designed to work with any OAuth service, and it supports email and passwordless authentication as well.

- **Styling**: For styling the application, it uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center, and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. It allows to rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML. It has a highly customizable configuration which gives you the flexibility to create a unique design of your own. It also offers responsive variants to style your websites on different screen sizes.
